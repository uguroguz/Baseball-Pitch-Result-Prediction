Hi all,
This is my thesis project. In this project, our aim was to predict baseball pitch results without excluding anomalies. To achieve this goal we have used R and Python programming languages. Various algorithms and features tested, based on these evaluations, we have created  MLP model that achieves 46% accuracy.
